# PyPhisher

A simple python tool for phishing

## Description:
This tool was created for the purpose of phishing during a penetration test. I wanted to create command line tool(to allow for automation) that would take a pre-crafted html email file then replace all the links and send the email. The replacing of links was something I was previously doing manually. This was inspired by SpearPhiser beta by Dave Kennedy from Trustedsec and a feature found in Cobalt Strike by Rapheal Mudge from Strategic Cyber
